## 🔷 What is Reltroner?

**Reltroner** is a long-term system-building project, not a demo portfolio.

It is an independent ERP and internal system architecture built with a single guiding principle:

> **Systems must stop accepting invalid states.**

Reltroner focuses on:
- 🧠 **System design with clear boundaries and invariants**
- 🔒 **Data integrity, immutability, and audit-grade correctness**
- 🏗️ **Backend-first architecture (Laravel, SQL, OIDC, SSO)**
- 📄 **Explicit documentation, root-cause analysis, and freeze governance**

This is not a feature-driven project.
Each phase is designed, audited, documented, and **frozen** before moving forward.

## 🔐 Engineering Philosophy

I intentionally work with **relational databases** and explicit business logic
because ERP systems are **systems of record**, not UI workflows.

Core principles I build around:
- Single write authority
- Immutable financial records
- Clear separation of read vs write paths
- Database-level constraints as the last line of defense
- No premature abstraction, no silent shortcuts

I believe correctness, clarity, and restraint scale better than speed.

## 🧊 Current Focus

- Finance & accounting core (audit-grade, invariant-driven)
- Authentication & SSO gateways (OIDC, delegated identity)
- System documentation as first-class engineering artifacts
- Designing systems that remain correct under pressure

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (by intent, not trend)

- **Backend:** Laravel, PHP, SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
- **Auth:** Keycloak, OpenID Connect
- **Frontend:** Next.js (used deliberately, not excessively)
- **Infra:** Minimal, observable, reproducible
- **Docs:** Markdown, architecture notes, audit reports

---

## 🧭 How I Work

I don’t optimize for velocity alone.

I optimize for:
- systems that cannot be misused accidentally
- systems that remain explainable years later
- systems that survive ownership and team changes

Reltroner is built solo, but structured as if it will be inherited.
