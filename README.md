## 🔷 About Me

I’m a backend engineer who enjoys building and maintaining internal systems with clear business rules and reliable data handling.

My recent work centers around:

* Backend APIs (Laravel / REST)
* Relational database design (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
* Role-based access control
* CI/CD automation and structured documentation
* Incremental improvements to existing systems

I focus on writing code that is readable, testable, and maintainable.

## 🔷 Current Project

I’m building a modular internal management system as a long-term laboratory for:

* Clean backend structure
* Explicit business logic
* Audit-friendly data handling
* Testing discipline
* Documentation clarity

This project is developed incrementally:
small modules, clear boundaries, and controlled iteration.

## 🔷 Engineering Approach

What I prioritize:

* Clear separation of concerns
* Explicit validation rules
* Database constraints where appropriate
* Practical logging and debugging discipline
* Avoiding unnecessary abstraction

I prefer improving existing systems over rewriting them.
